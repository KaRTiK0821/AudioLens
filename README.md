# 🎵 AudioLens: Spotify Track Analysis & Clustering

AudioLens is a machine learning project that analyzes Spotify tracks and groups them into clusters based on audio features like **danceability**, **energy**, **tempo**, and more. The project uses **K-Means clustering**, PCA for dimensionality reduction, and includes a simple recommendation system for suggesting similar songs.
